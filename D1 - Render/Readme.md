Modelling Process

Guitar - Owen
The modelling process of the guitar started by finding an appropriate reference image, aswell as using the real life object in person as a form of reference. Using the image (https://static.bax-shop.es/image/product/30293/2269489/923d1d0f/1592490587Yamaha-F310-akoestische-folk-gitaar-naturel_1.jpg) Owen was able to trace over the shape of the Guitar's body with a belier curve. After getting this shape Owen then filled and extruded it to get the required thickness of the guitar body. Next he created a cube and moved the vertices over the neck of the guitar on the reference image. The same process of creating cubes and moving vertices was used for the rest of the parts of the object such as the tuning pegs and pick guard. The materials were each texture painted on blender, aiming for a low poly-cartoony style.

Viviarium - Iona
Iona first did a few drawings as a reference for the object, then began modelling the basic shape of the vivarium, normal maps were used to add depth to the mesh. Meshes were textured as they were created using texture paint. Following this some finer details like rocks and a water tray were added to the vivarium as well as plants that Iona had created previously. After the vivarium itself was completed, Iona created a mesh for the Snake, then texture painted it using her pet snake as a reference.


Mushroom Lamp - Kumi
First, concept art was drawn for the model, allowing Kumi to understand better how the pieces of the model would come together, along with this Kumi was able to use the real life object as a form of reference. Next, the basic mesh shape was created for both the body and head of the mushroom, followed by its hands and feet. Next the mushroom cap was texture painted to give the signature red with white spots. After this, the main body of the mushroom as well as the arms and legs were texture painted, giving it the cute face and warm colour.

Setting up the Scene
Iona modelled the objects within the scene; a bed, chair, desk, dresser, rug and window. The objects were arranged in such a way that left ample room for each of our created objects to fit in well and naturally in the space. One main light was added to the center of the ceiling of the room. Once modelled, Owen texture painted the meshes, aiming for a cartoony style.

Following this, each of the objects was added to the scene in different areas around the room. Each object was lit up with 3 lights, using 2 fill lights and 1 back light. The final images were rednered using EEVEE or Cycles, this was dependent on our different machines working with the different renders.
